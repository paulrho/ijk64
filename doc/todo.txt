* FOR Loop creation needs to be optimised too (still interpreted) - note: this is Issue#25 (previously)

think about this:
you could push Gosubs and Fors onto the acode runtime stack 
  both these stacks are now combined too - so logically it should work
  would alow acode coding of gosub/return for/next
optimise the command parameter list petspeeding (currently it doesnt do it) - for other functions

interesting...
dump in acode and ainstructioncode format the whole execution compilation

DOC
profiling:
java -agentlib:hprof=cpu=samples,depth=100,interval=5,lineno=y,thread=y,file=out.hprof -jar C64.jar -z m.basic -r -x


====================================================================================================================
REJECTED
c64 INT function should just truncate decimal, still allows very big values
\ kept this as is - matches C64

DONE
~~~~
DONE acode MID needs to be copy of eval version
DONE - mid needs 2 and 3 var version, did this by adding params for func
DONE - update LSET and others to go on both backing screens
DONE 2) GOTO #
   GOSUB #
   IF THEN #
     DONE!!
DONE 3) DEF FN - compile it
    (currently marked as reject)
    DONE!!
DONE *) optimise DEFFN (currently just rejected compile and interpreted)
DONE 4) optimise the NEXT - currently string processing -
  at least turn it into near-a-code NEXT [mem] statements (where mem could be -2 (none))
    DONE!!
  (these three changes take it from 6800 to 7500 benchmark)
DONE 5) add ELSE !!!! (search through line looking for :ELSE)
    DONE - and compiled
DONE 11) check the chained case where you jump into the commands half way through
DONE * when clear screen - should set colour to cursor colour =DONE
DONE #26) F5 to run!
DONE #27) make poke198,0 clear the buffer!
DONE #31) c64 DEFFN param should be local
DONE #32) c64 STR$(-5) should not return leading space


====================================================================================================================

not done:

) directory traversing (local/absolute/x:drives/cloud)
 also think about (like cygdrive)
  cloud/x/y/z
  
) visualise all progs (screendumps)

) cloud drive explorer
  maybe just a web page?

) 3rd plane or sprites on graphics

  
#15) ask question on exit (close window) of changed program
*    create a standalone full mp2 like equivalent for timing

0) optimise
   work out why some things loose 5%

#25) FOR -> compile this too!

2) compile IF e THEN A ..... \n B    to e BEQ toB | A ... B - requires compiling both sides initially = maybe redo ALL IF function
    or a BEQ or BNE based on the first time compiled - but not filled out until the alternative path used

4) make REM truely take no running time after compiling - attempted - looking for a nicer way

5) allow sounds to load off web too


6) allow break from an io (especially net)

7) when you list"prog" and it is not there - it should not do the list

8) when list program dont go ultra slow on large screens

    make other pokes work

#28) superexpander graphics
#30) i/o from ports joysticks etc

10) check the goto gosub ifthen # optimisations to affect edge case (where the next instructions might overlap)
12) LIST a,b,c=1,2,3  (now does a,b,c=3,2,1 ) - can be done
   but note, this is a unintended language extension that I don't use anyway - 
   could mark it as reject in the meantime

20) sprites

-----
* doesn't allow input c : (treats as string)
* exact 40 chars with ; - note sure this is an issue
* DATA/READ cant read data unless run already (should force a caching somehow)
* space between func name and ( (should be allowed but isnt')

** Feature completions:
*implement:
. go
. usr
. cmd

** Feature Expansions:
* required feature:  copy paste part of screen and full log
* required 128 expansions:
  * print using
  * else
  * begin
  * bend

* implement:
