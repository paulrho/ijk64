c64 DEFFN param should be local
c64 STR$(-5) should not return leading space
c64 INT function should just truncate decimal, still allows very big values

acode MID needs to be copy of eval version
DONE - mid needs 2 and 3 var version, did this by adding params for func

think about this:
you could push Gosubs and Fors onto the acode runtime stack 
  both these stacks are now combined too - so logically it should work
  would alow acode coding of gosub/return for/next
optimise the command parameter list petspeeding (currently it doesnt do it)

optimise DEFFN (currently just rejected compile and interpreted)
