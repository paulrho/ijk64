* c64 DEFFN param should be local
* c64 STR$(-5) should not return leading space
* ask question on exit of changed program
* F5 to run
* create a standalone full mp2 like equivalent for timing

c64 INT function should just truncate decimal, still allows very big values
\ kept this as is - matches C64

DONE acode MID needs to be copy of eval version
DONE - mid needs 2 and 3 var version, did this by adding params for func

--
think about this:
you could push Gosubs and Fors onto the acode runtime stack 
  both these stacks are now combined too - so logically it should work
  would alow acode coding of gosub/return for/next
optimise the command parameter list petspeeding (currently it doesnt do it)

optimise DEFFN (currently just rejected compile and interpreted)

update LSET and others to go on both backing screens

interesting...
dump in acode and ainstructioncode format the whole execution compilation
